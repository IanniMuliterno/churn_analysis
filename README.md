# Churn Analysis
Welcome to the Churn Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to predict which customers are likely to leave a service or subscription. Understanding churn is crucial for businesses looking to improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall customer satisfaction. 

Another important topic is, explaining complex results to non-tec stakeholders, to deal with the output of a black box model such as xgboost, I've leveraged shap package to interpret the importance of the variables.
